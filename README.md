# CS361 - Quotes Microservice

## How to Use
- Download the executable file from the releases tab.
- Running the executable will create two empty text files in its directory: `pipe.txt` and `quotes.txt`.
- Communicate with the program by writing commands in `pipe.txt`. You must replace the entire contents of the text file. Commands are case-sensitive.
  - `add: <new quote>` — Add `<new quote>` to `quotes.txt`.
  - `quote` — Generate a random quote from `quotes.txt`.
  - `quit` — Quit the program.

## Adding Quotes Manually
You may manually add quotes to `quotes.txt` while the program is **not running**. Quotes are delimited by line breaks.
